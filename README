For each question keep either Y for Yes or N for No. Remove the other letter. 
1) My code compiles. Y
2) I used a diff tool to match my output to the sample output. Y (discrepancies explained below)
3) I implemented and tested Tuna functionality (Step 1). Y
4) I implemented and tested Shark functionality (Step 1). Y
5) I refactored the model using STL (Step 2). Y
6) I implemented and tested Exceptions (Step 3). Y
7) I enabled creation of new objects during program execution (Step 4). Y
8) I implemented persistent objects (Step 5). Y
9) I implemented and tested Sharknado (Step 6). Y

Additional Comments:
Minor discrepancies with sample output include:
1) Extra empty character in grid. Just the way I print my grid
2) Show status order of objects. My objects are always ordered in ascending order withing their respective lists, therefore show status
   prints status's in that order.
3) After the game is restored at time 26 T1 finds a mate then mating proceeds as described (2 time ticks and what not). In the sample 
   output a new tuna T5 is born instantly at time 26. Everything after that shows substantial differences because of this.

*Last thing: My sharks can swim. Made no sense why they couldn't. Sharks even swim in their sleep.
